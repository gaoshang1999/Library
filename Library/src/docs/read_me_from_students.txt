1, required 4 use case has been done.
   Use case 1 - Login. When run ui.Start, Login window will start.
		        We make some access control, after login. Different user will see different operation menu;
		        for example: user 103, password 111, has the role of BOTH, so he can see all operations
		        			 user 101, password xyz, has the role of LIBRARIAN, so he can only do check out or print checkout record or Determine whether overdue .
		        			 user 102, password abc, has the role of ADMIN, so he can only do some administration work(Add library member, Add book copy, Add Book).
